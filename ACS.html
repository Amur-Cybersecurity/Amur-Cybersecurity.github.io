<h2>About:</h2>



<p  style="font-family:courier;">We here at ACS are focused on the research and development of cybersecure computer systems.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:baskerville;"><pre>Many factors need to be considering when establishing a new form of cybersecure infrastructure.

	• Cybersecure systems lack artificial correction on a fundamental level.
	
	• Machine code is not complete and theres good reason for that. 
	
	• Exploitation of backdoors by quantum computer systems pose a threat to national security.</pre></h2>

<pre>Rationally speaking these threats are 5-10 years in front of us, the threat of cybersecurity remains a vital component of current events.

We are here to provide top of the line security analytic programs and defenses. 

Our research into the depths of computer science as well as the configurations of

current motherboards, chipset architectures, and many other hardware components, 

has revealed to us that there is much room for improvement.

A car can only go as fast as the skilled driver is capable of navigating the roads.

	"A straight road is the easiest to reach your hightest speeds."

From there we have developed one-of-a-kind cybersecurity software henceforth referred to as Amur Cybersecurity Software.
</pre>

<pre>Amur Cybersecurity is a cybersecurity software program capable of defending classical computer systems from quantum computer attacks.

<h3> THIS PORTION IS FOR THE ACS TEAM ONLY (theres not a whole lot of attention around us right now, also i hope we 
    
    get popular and people use this shit anyway to learn how to do this shit themselves, 
    
    if you have internet access you can learn how to do, and then go out and do, anything thats on there. . . 
    
    thats 175 Zetabytes of shit you can learn to do.....and then do.)</h3>
<p>
It looks like were going to have to create a mountable disk, one that remains constant throughout any install.

Take discord for example, look at how they're disk mounts to the desktop and then remains there until the install is finished.
I've noticed many of this installs do not leave the system unless they are deleted by the user. In regard to such techniques I 
advise we follow suite and copy the "traits of the masses" to avoid spending time buidling "too much".
