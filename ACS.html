 <p>Rationally speaking these threats are 5-10 years in front of us, the threat of cybersecurity remains a vital component of current events.
 We are here to provide top of the line security analytic programs and defenses. Our research into the depths of computer science as well as the configurations of current motherboards, chipset architectures, and many other hardware components, has revealed to us that there is much room for improvement. <br> A car can only go as fast as the skilled driver is capable of navigating the roads. 

"A straight road is the easiest to reach your hightest speeds."

From there we have developed one-of-a-kind cybersecurity software henceforth referred to as Amur Cybersecurity Software.</p>
