<h2>About:</h2>



<p  style="font-family:courier;">We here at ACS are focused on the research and development of cybersecure computer systems.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:baskerville;"><pre>Many factors need to be considering when establishing a new form of cybersecure infrastructure.

	• Cybersecure systems lack artificial correction on a fundamental level.
	
	• Machine code is not complete and theres good reason for that. 
	
	• Exploitation of backdoors by quantum computer systems pose a threat to national security.</pre></h2>

<p style="color:blue;">Sworadix LLC</p> 
 
<pre>Rationally speaking these threats are 5-10 years in front of us, the threat of cybersecurity remains a vital component of current events.

We are here to provide top of the line security analytic programs and defenses. 

Our research into the depths of computer science as well as the configurations of

current motherboards, chipset architectures, and many other hardware components, 

has revealed to us that there is much room for improvement.

A car can only go as fast as the skilled driver is capable of navigating the roads.

	"A straight road is the easiest to reach your hightest speeds."

From there we have developed one-of-a-kind cybersecurity software henceforth referred to as Amur Cybersecurity Software.
</pre>

<pre>Amur Cybersecurity is a cybersecurity software program capable of defending classical computer systems from quantum computer attacks.

<h3> THIS PORTION IS FOR THE ACS TEAM</h3>

It looks like were going to have to create a mountable disk, one that remains constant throughout any install.

Take discord for example, look at how they're disk mounts to the desktop and then remains there until the install is finished.

I've noticed many of this installs do not leave the system unless they are deleted by the user. 

In regard to such techniques I advise we follow suite and copy the "traits of the masses" to avoid spending time buidling "too much".
	
IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT HOW WERE GOING TO BUILD OUR APPLICATION, WERE JUST GOING TO DO IT ON THAT MACHINE AND RECORD WHAT WE DID AND THEN REPLAY THAT IN THE CODE.
	
We figure the basic process for installation on Linux, Windows, MacOS. Every other company in the world has already done the research on how to
access the architecture, chip, and other specs of the system of a laptop for install. There is plenty of open source software to get us from wherever
we are to wherever we want to be. The only wall is the address bar and internet access. We can save loads of time by copying these open source tehcniques (downloading a popular app)
	and dissecting that app to figure out how they made it so easily accessible and downloadable by every system. In this way we also find how to defend from computer viruses
	which do almost the exact same thing, jus tthat the user doesnt give permission for such. Remember, we're selling something that says "hi can I do something
	to your laptop for a minute or two?", and the user trusts that we are downloading the app we said we were going to download. Seems our app is basically built, the hard part
	is integrated the new hashing algorithm that seperates us from the otehr guys, which gives our system that "special" security we have been discussing.
